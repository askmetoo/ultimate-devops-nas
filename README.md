## What Ultimate Ansible NAS Does

Use the Ultimate Ansible NAS to set up any of the following applications listed below on your home server.

Use an owned domain name to configure applications to be accessible externally from your home network; they'll be configured with a sensible hostname and DNS gets updated accordingly if your home IP address changes.
